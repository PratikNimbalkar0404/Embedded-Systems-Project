Project Part 1 Goal: Detect car horns on Sensortile M4 micro-controller at high accuracy and low latency (not missing audio)
Tutorials and resources: Audio event detection on Sensortile Cortex M4
(a) Train a model including the class car_horn model training
(b) Evaluate quantized model accuracy on laptop model quantization and evaluation
(c) Evaluate deployed model latency on Sensortile M4 model deployment
